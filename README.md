For this challenge, I was tasked with scraping data from an webpage, and then using pandas to analyze the data pulled. 

This assignment consisted of two technical products:

1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

The two analysis files that cover these are located in the "Analysis" folder, and the CSV file created is located in the "Resources" folder.

To complete this I was able to go off the solved class activities from that week and didn't have too much trouble with it. 

Thanks for taking the time to grade my assignment!
